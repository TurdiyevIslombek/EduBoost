# Security Considerations for EduBoost

## Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Uses Clerk for secure authentication
- ✅ Proper middleware protection for protected routes
- ⚠️ Admin access is hardcoded to specific email - consider using environment variable

## Data Protection
- ✅ Environment variables properly used for secrets
- ✅ `.env*` files are gitignored
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
- ✅ File upload restrictions (4MB, images only)
- ✅ Proper ownership validation for uploads

## File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Authentication required for uploads
- ✅ Proper cleanup of old files

## API Security
- ✅ TRPC with proper authentication middleware
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas

## Recommendations for Production
1. Move admin email to environment variable: `ADMIN_EMAIL`
2. Consider rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Add CSP headers for additional XSS protection
4. Remove console.log statements in production build
5. Add proper monitoring and logging
6. Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
